Exercise 4 part 1

MOEAFramework-2.13

Changes to existing code base:

Examples -> Example2.java file has been modified

Problems: ZDT1, ZDT2, DTLZ3 (3), DTLZ4 (3)
Algortihms: NSGA-II , MOEA/D
Population sizes: 20,100
seeds: 10 
Analysis metric: Hypervolume 
Plots generated: 160


In order to use DTLZ3 and DTLZ4 with 3 objectives,
myDTLZ3 and myDTLZ4 classes have been declared.
In order to check the objectives, there is a loop at the last part of the  main function.

ZDT1, ZDT2 can be evaluated as normal. 

Due to dependency problems, we were not able to define a new class with new file.
